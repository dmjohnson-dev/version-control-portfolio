Part E1 – Merge Conflict Resolution Summary
-------------------------------------------
The merge conflict occurred in README.md when merging the Test branch into the working branch, because both branches modified the same file.

Conflict markers were visible as:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Git Version: 2.43.0
=======
Student ID: 012578297
>>>>>>> Test

To resolve it, I opened README.md in an editor, kept both lines, removed the conflict markers, and saved:
Student ID: 012578297
Git Version: 2.43.0

I then ran:
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in README.md: keep Student ID and Git version"
and pushed the working branch to GitLab.
